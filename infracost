"Shift-Left Cloud Cost Estimation: Integrating Infracost into CI/CD for FinOps-Driven DevOps"


This project introduces a cost-aware software delivery pipeline that integrates Infracost into the CI/CD workflow, allowing engineering teams to preview cloud costs before infrastructure is provisioned. By incorporating cost feedback during the planning and development stages, teams can avoid surprises, make informed decisions, and collaborate with FinOps early in the SDLC.

The solution is built around:

Terraform + Infracost for cost estimation

CI/CD tooling (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab, Spinnaker)

Optional Slack/MS Teams alerts or PR comments for team visibility

===
üí∞ Cost Awareness	Prevent unexpected cloud spend by surfacing cost info before infrastructure is deployed
üîç Visibility	Adds cost diffs directly to pull requests and CI dashboards
üöß Guardrails	Enforce policy thresholds like "no change > $500/month without approval"
ü§ù Collaboration	Improves transparency between engineering, DevOps, and finance
üìà Continuous Improvement	Helps developers learn the cost impact of infra choices over time


====
Area	Skills
IaC	Terraform, HCL
CI/CD	GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Spinnaker
DevOps	Bash/Python scripting, Infrastructure planning
FinOps	Basic understanding of cloud billing/pricing models
Monitoring	(Optional) Integration with dashboards or Slack/MS Teams for reporting

====
This initiative empowers developers and DevOps engineers to adopt a "shift-left" FinOps mindset by integrating Infracost into their daily workflows. The project demonstrates how to inject real-time infrastructure cost estimates into the pull request and pipeline stages of the SDLC, allowing engineers to see:

How much a change will cost (before it's applied),

What the delta is compared to the current state,

Whether the change violates team or org-level budget thresholds.

By aligning cloud cost visibility with GitOps and CI/CD practices, the project drives a more responsible, sustainable, and collaborative approach to infrastructure provisioning.


===

By attending this session, you will gain practical insights into integrating FinOps principles directly into your CI/CD pipelines using tools like Infracost and Spinnaker. 
You'll learn how to estimate infrastructure costs before deployment, enforce cost-related policies during the SDLC, and make informed, budget-conscious decisions without slowing down delivery. 
This session will empower you to build cost-aware DevOps workflows, improve collaboration with finance teams, and drive a culture of accountability and efficiency in your cloud-native projects. 
Whether you're an engineer, DevOps practitioner, or architect, you'll walk away with actionable strategies and tools to reduce cloud waste and deliver smarter, more cost-effective software.

In the era of cloud-native applications and rapid deployments, cost has become the invisible bug in our delivery pipelines. While DevOps has enabled faster shipping, it often leaves finance teams scrambling to keep up with unpredictable cloud bills. This session bridges that gap by introducing a FinOps-driven approach to Continuous Delivery, empowering developers and DevOps engineers to factor in cost awareness as a first-class citizen in the SDLC.

Using tools like Infracost and Spinnaker, we‚Äôll demonstrate how to inject real-time cost estimates into pull requests and pipelines, set up budget guardrails, and make cloud cost data actionable and visible where it matters most‚Äîinside developer workflows. We‚Äôll walk through a live example of how a Terraform infrastructure change can be automatically flagged, validated, or approved based on cost policies before reaching production.

Attendees will leave with a clear blueprint for implementing cost-aware CI/CD pipelines, integrating FinOps into their teams without disrupting developer velocity. This session is ideal for engineers, SREs, architects, and DevOps practitioners who want to improve cloud efficiency, enforce budget-conscious governance, and foster a culture of financial accountability in their delivery process.
